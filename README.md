# 📘 Flowcast SDK — Project Definition & Architecture Overview

## Overview

**Flowcast** is a Unity SDK for deterministic multiplayer game simulation using a shared input-action architecture. It supports both turn-based and tick-based systems and is designed to be decoupled from Unity-specific APIs or networking libraries, making it portable to client or server environments.

## Vision

To provide a modular and extensible multiplayer gameplay framework where:

- All game logic is driven by user inputs and server-validated actions.
- Game state is updated deterministically on all clients using shared logic.
- The server may run full game logic (e.g. turn-based) or delegate to clients for complex real-time simulations (e.g. tower defense).
- Sync, rollback, and observability are built-in to handle desync and latency.

> **DI Container Extension**: [Flowcast.VContainer (DI Integration)](https://github.com/omidkianifarkingkode/Flowcast/tree/main/Unity/Assets/Flowcast.VContainer)
> This SDK supports integration with the [VContainer](https://github.com/hadashiA/VContainer) dependency injection framework via the official extension repository above.
